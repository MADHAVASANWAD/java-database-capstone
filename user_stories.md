User Story: Task Creation and Assignment

Title: As a project manager, I want to create and assign tasks to team members, so that I can effectively manage project progress and ensure timely completion.

Acceptance Criteria:





The system must allow me to create a task with a title, description, due date, and priority level.



The system must enable me to assign the task to one or more team members from a list of available users.



The system must notify assigned team members via email or in-app notification when a task is assigned.

Priority: High
Story Points: 5

Notes:





Ensure the task creation form includes validation for mandatory fields (e.g., title and due date).



Consider edge cases where a team member is unavailable or the due date is in the past.
